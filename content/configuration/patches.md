***ts-defold*** uses the [patch-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package) module to patch the source of the [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/) project to provide additional *features*, *workarounds*, or *hacks* needed to facilitate the project.

## Troubleshooting

You may need to run `npm run postinstall` if your npm environment is configured to not automatically run `postinstall` scripts, or if there was an error in the `npm install` process.

## Future :crystal_ball:

Anything that is contained in a patch will become a future PR to the [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/) project.
